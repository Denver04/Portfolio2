          I was the one of the main front-end developer for the company. We
          built the NFT website Site whose front-end design was under my team. I
          used <strong>ReactJS</strong> , <strong>HTML</strong> , and
          <strong> CSS</strong>. Learn to work with colleagues / manager.
          Discussing things in meet with manager was the best thing.
